## 🚀 Quick Start (2 mins)

**1. Installing Nextpy**

Open your terminal and prepare for an adventure of a lifetime!

```bash
pip install nextpy
```

**(Remember, Python 3.7 or later is required.)**

**2. Initializing Your App**

Navigate to the desired directory for your project in the terminal. Use the `nextpy init` command to initialize a template app in your new directory.

```bash
nextpy init
```

**3. Choose your template:**

For now, just press enter to automatically default to the blank template.
```md
    Blank Template: A simple single page template
    Base Template: A multi-page app with a sidebar
```

**4. Running the App**

In the same directory where you previously ran nextpy init, enter the following command:

```bash
nextpy run
```

**5. View the App:**

Check out your app by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> [!NOTE]
> Your application is now fully functional. To view the frontend, navigate to `localhost:3000`. The backend server is accessible at `localhost:8000`.
> While it's unlikely you'll ever directly interact with it, the backend API documentation can be found at `localhost:8000/docs`, and the openapi.json file is located at `localhost:8000/openapi.json`.


## 🎨 Start with a template!

We speedup your development with a [ever growing list of community templates](https://github.com/dot-agent/nextpy/tree/main/app-examples). Some examples:

<table border="0">
  <tr>

### Setting Up the Template
1. Copy the template files to your local folder.
2. Install necessary dependencies with **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**.
3. Initialize your app by running **`nextpy init`**.
4. Launch the app with **`nextpy run`** to see it in action. To check the site visit `localhost:3000`

### 🤣 Building a Joke Generator App (5 mins)

Edit `myapp/myapp.py` to create your app.

#### 1. Import Libraries

```python
import nextpy as xt
import pyjokes
```

Start by importing `nextpy` for development and `pyjokes` for random jokes.

#### 2. Set Up the App State

```python
class State(xt.State):
    joke: str = "Click the button to get a joke!"

    def generate_joke(self):
        self.joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
```

Create a `State` class with a `joke` variable. Use `generate_joke` to fetch new jokes.

#### 3. Design the Main Page

```python
def index():
    layout = xt.vstack(
        xt.text(State.joke, font_size="2em"),
        xt.button("Generate Joke", on_click=State.generate_joke),
    )
    return layout
```

The `index` function arranges a joke display and a button. `vstack` is used to stack components vertically, while `hstack` is used to stack components horizontally.

#### 4. Optional Styling
```md
def index():
    layout = xt.vstack(
        xt.text(State.joke, font_size="2em"),
        xt.button("Generate Joke", on_click=State.generate_joke),

        spacing="1em",
        align_items="center",
        justify_content="center",
        height="100vh",
   )
    return layout
```
The `spacing` attribute adds space between the `text` and `button` elements, while `align_items` and `justify_content` ensure that these elements are centered. The stack's `height` is set to 100% of the Viewport Height (`100vh`), which allows the vertical stack to fill the entire height of your screen.

#### 5. Setup the app

```python
app = xt.App()
app.add_page(index)

```

Set up the app, add the main page. To view the frontend, navigate to `localhost:3000`.
